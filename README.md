# Cerebras-Inference-Cookbook

This repository showcases example workflows and code snippets built specifically to take advantage of Cerebras’ ultra-fast inference capabilities. Whether you’re building agent pipelines, structured output generators, or multi-turn tools, these examples demonstrate how to harness low-latency inference for more interactive and iterative LLM applications.

To get started, you’ll need access to the Cerebras Inference API and an API key. If you don't have one already, you can get one here. 

Once you have your key, set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export CEREBRAS_API_KEY=<your API key>
```

All code samples are written in Python and intentionally designed to highlight real-time performance. From streaming token-by-token responses to iterative summarization loops, each recipe showcases patterns that benefit from Cerebras’ high-throughput inference engine.
